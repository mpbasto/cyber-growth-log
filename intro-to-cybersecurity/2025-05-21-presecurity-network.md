# 🧠 TryHackMe: Pre-Security – Network Fundamentals  
📅 Date: 2025-05-21  
📍 Modules Covered:
- What is Networking
- Introduction to LAN
- OSI Model
- Packets & Frames
- Extending Your Network

---

## 🛠️ What I Worked On
I completed the entire **Network Fundamentals** section of the TryHackMe Pre-Security path. This included:
- Understanding basic networking concepts and why networks are needed.
- Learning how **LANs** function, with an intro to switches, hubs, and routers.
- Learning about the **OSI Model** and how data moves through each of the 7 layers.
- Breaking down the structure of **packets and frames**, including headers and payloads.
- Exploring how networks scale and interconnect with the broader Internet.

---

## ⚠️ What I Struggled With
- Memorising the **OSI Model** and remembering which protocols/devices belong to each layer.
---

## ✅ Wins, Surprises, and Next Steps

### 🎉 Wins
- I understand the concept of **encapsulation** — each OSI layer adding its own data.

### 🤯 Surprises
- I built confidence in basic networking terminology and flow diagrams.

### 🔜 Next Steps

- Move on to **How the Web Works**
- Begin using **Wireshark** to observe packet flow and practice recognizing layers in real traffic.
- Create `/notes/networking.md` with a cheat sheet for:
  - OSI model layers
  - Common protocols and ports
  - Key terms (MAC vs IP, DNS, ARP)
- Try to sketch a simple **home network topology** in `/labs/`
