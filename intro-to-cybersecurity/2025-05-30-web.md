# TryHackMe: Pre-Security - How the Web Works

📅 Date: 2025-05-30
📍 Modules Covered:

- The client-server model
- DNS resolution process
- HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Web requests (GET, POST)
- Browser rendering flow
- Status codes (200, 301, 404, 500)

---

## 🛠️ What I Worked On

I completed the **How the Web Works** module, which introduced:

- The structure and purpose of the **World Wide Web** vs the Internet.
- The **client-server model** and the roles of browsers and web servers.
- The basics of **HTTP/HTTPS**, including methods like GET and POST.
- How **DNS resolution** turns domain names into IP addresses.
- How the browser handles web content (HTML, CSS, JS) and communicates over ports.

## ⚠️ What I Struggled With

- Understanding how **DNS lookup** interacts with caching and resolvers.
- Remembering the full flow of a **web request**.

## ✅ Wins, Surprises, and Next Steps

### 🎉 Wins

- Redirection codes (301/302) can hide phishing redirects.
- DNS lookup can be observed in tools like Wireshark.

### 🤯 Surprises

- DNS involves more layers than I expected — with recursive and authoritative lookups.

### 🔜 Next Steps

- Use **Wireshark** to follow the request/response flow of a website like `icanhazip.com`.
- Add cheat notes in `/notes/web.md`:
  - DNS resolution stages
  - Client vs Server overview
- Sketch a **web request flow diagram** and store in `/labs/`
