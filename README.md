# 🛡️ Cyber Growth Log: My Journey into Cybersecurity & Privacy
Welcome to my personal log of learning cybersecurity. I'm a software engineer expanding into security with a focus on web app vulnerabilities, cloud security, and practical hands-on skills via platforms like TryHackMe.
This repository documents my personal journey into cybersecurity, with a focus on building practical, real-world skills and exploring digital security challenges faced by high-profile individuals and organisations.
It's not a teaching resource — it's a learning record.

## 🔍 What you'll find here:

- Structured learning notes from platforms like TryHackMe, OWASP, and HackTheBox.

- Personal threat models, checklists, and simplified explainers

- A growing VIP security toolkit aimed at helping individuals maintain digital and physical privacy

- Reflections, resources, and useful links to deepen both technical skills and security thinking

**📅 Goal**: To transition from junior software engineer to cybersecurity specialist, by merging technical upskilling with modern privacy concerns, human threat modeling, and hands-on tools.
