## 🛠️ What I Worked On

I completed the **Linux Fundamentals** module, covering:

- The Linux file system and core structure (`/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, etc.).
- Terminal commands for **navigation**, **file management**, and **permissions**.
- Managing **users, groups**, and understanding **file permission bits**.
- Viewing and managing **running processes** with tools like `ps`, `top`, `kill`.
- Installing/removing software using package managers like `apt`.

## ⚠️ What I Struggled With

- Understanding the use of `chmod` and how the number system works (`755`, `644`, etc).
- The difference between **absolute** and **relative** paths tripped me up occasionally.

## ✅ Wins, Surprises, and Next Steps

### 🎉 Wins

- I finally understand how to read `rwx` permissions.

### 🤯 Surprises

- Learning that everything in Linux is treated as a file — even devices and processes.

### 🔜 Next Steps

- Add a cheat sheet in `/notes/linux.md`:
  - Command reference
  - Permissions guide
  - User/group basics
- Explore **log locations** (`/var/log/`) to prep for Blue Team content.
