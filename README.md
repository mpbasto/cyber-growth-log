# Cyber Growth Log

Welcome to my personal log of learning cybersecurity. I'm a software engineer expanding into security with a focus on web app vulnerabilities, cloud security, and practical hands-on skills via platforms like TryHackMe.

This repo contains notes, summaries, and reflections from my journey. It's not a teaching resource â€” it's a learning record.
